Work with a Serverless stack, contract first and with Lambdas in TypeScript.

Eliminate the complexity of generating the infrastructure needed to expose an API and just focus on coding the Lambdas that run the business rules

From an OpenAPI Contract, you have the generation of the necessary infrastructure below:

- API Gateway;
- Lambdas (each endpoint generate one different Lambda);
- Cloudwatch Logs;
- X-Ray Tracing;
- MÃ©tricas

Also generates lambda source codes with the structure below:
- Core Components;  
- Controllers;  
- Use Cases;  
- Error Handling;  
- API Schema Types
